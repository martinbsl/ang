A developer can mark a testng-test as "acceptance-test"
so that it will always run successfully even if the test fails.

 Test marked          |              |
 as "acceptance-test" | Test fails ? | Test result
======================+==============+==============
        YES           |     YES      |   SUCCESS
        YES           |      NO      |   SUCCESS
         NO           |     YES      |   FAILURE
         NO           |      NO      |   SUCCESS

A developer can define an acceptance-test as "done"
so that it must not fail any longer.

 Test-Method    |              |
 marked "@Done" | Test fails ? | Test result
================+==============+==============
        YES     |     YES      |   FAILURE
        YES     |      NO      |   SUCCESS
         NO     |     YES      |   FAILURE
         NO     |      NO      |   SUCCESS
